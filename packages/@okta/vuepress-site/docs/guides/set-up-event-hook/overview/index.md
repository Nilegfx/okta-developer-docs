Event Hooks are outbound calls from Okta that can be used to notify your own software systems of events occurring in your Okta org. See [Event Hooks](/docs/concepts/event-hooks/) for an overview. This guide provides the steps for setting up an Event Hook in your Okta org:

1. Implement your external web service to receive Event Hook calls from Okta.
1. Register the endpoint of your external service with Okta and configure Event Hook parameters.
1. Verify to Okta that you control the endpoint you have registered.
1. Begin receving ongoing delivery of event notifications at the endpoint.
